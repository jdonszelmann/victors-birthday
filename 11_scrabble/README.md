For this challenge, you will have to prove your worth by playing the perfect scrabble word.
I've made it a word that _you_ most definitely know, but that my kidnappers have never in their lives used (although they seem to speak perfect Dutch?)...

Fill in the board with the missing word with the letters at your disposal. That will be your password.
