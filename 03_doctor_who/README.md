I heard my neighbors play something that I'm sure you will find familliar. With a bit of luck, it will throw
off my kidnappers though. Here are some fragments I heard, that should guide you in the right direction:

"How many? Sixty?"
"Where were you hiding that?"
"I wouldn't mind if you did. Not a bad idea, Lynda with a Y"
"the dish Gaffabeque originated on which planet?"
"Exterminate!"
