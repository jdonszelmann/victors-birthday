If someone is reading this, I'm in great danger, I have been kidnapped and all I could do is leave you this USB stick with puzzles and cryptic hints referring to my whereabouts. I cannot state my location outright, as I don't want the exact details of my location to get into the wrong hands!

As you're a close friend of mine, I've tailored the puzzles to be only solvable by you. More specifically, these 24 challenges are only _meant_ to be solved by a 24 year old Victor. The first challenge is very easy, as I'm trying to scare away the babies (<1 year olds - how did you even get this far?!?). Good luck!

For each puzzle, you will get a password that is used to unlock the next puzzle. Sometimes, the puzzles will contain hints referring to my location.

Each puzzle requires signing in to a new user, I've provided scripts for that. 

For this part of the challenge, your password is the answers to all 3 of the sub-problems concatenated (including commas or dots). This 
What is 3+2?
