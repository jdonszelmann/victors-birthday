Now that you've gotten better at math, here is the next challenge (since my kidnappers have not yet mastered _integration by parts_):

\int_{}^{} x^69 * e^x \,dx 

This is an integral that can be computed using repeated integration by parts. Find the general form of the terms in the result and give the coefficient (:)) for x^42.
